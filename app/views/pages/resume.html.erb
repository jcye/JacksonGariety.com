  <h1>About</h1>
  <article>
    <p>I've been doing full-stack web design & development for over 4 years.</p>
    <p>You should hire me if you need a developer who demands perfection, organization, interface elegance, and has a unique understanding of human design patterns. I specialize in user interaction design but also have a strong foothold in NodeJS and Ruby on Rails development.</p>

    <ul class="inside">
      <li>Introduced to the world of business and technology while doing freelance web application development.</li>
      <li>I also attended Grant High School (but didn't pay any attention).</li>
    </ul><br>
    
    <strong>2012</strong>
    <ul class="inside">
      <li>Inspired, I started building a frighteningly ambitious social web platform called <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/hashtraffic-plugin/">HashTraffic</a>.</li>
      <li>I took the beta software to <a href="http://portland.startupweekend.org">Portland Startup Weekend</a> and received a standing ovation from the crowd. I won the 'best developer' and 'best execution' awards.</li>
      <li>Joined the <a href="http://studentrnd.com">StudentRND</a> family and hosted CodeDay Portland, the world's only hackathon for students.</li>
      <li>This was the year I realized I wanted to be an inventor.</li>
    </ul><br>
    
    <strong>2013</strong>
    <ul class="inside">
      <li>Joined the <a href="http://www.techstars.com">TechStars</a> family at the <a href="http://nikeaccelerator.com">Nike+ startup accelerator</a> and helped build the products of 10 amazing fledgling companies.</li>
      <li>Taught the USA's first public high-school web development, and app architecture course at <a href="http://www.pps.k12.or.us/schools/grant/">Grant High School</a>.</li>

    </ul><br>
    <strong>Development</strong>
    <p>My favorite environment is NodeJS, but I've been writing Ruby and PHP for as long as I've been writing code.</p>
    <p>Here's an list of technologies I've used sorted by when I last used them:</p>
    <ul class="inside">
      <li>NodeJS</li>
      <li>EmberJS</li>
      <li>HTML5</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
      <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
      <li>AngularJS</li>
      <li>CSS3</li>
      <li>SQL</li>
      <li>NoSQL</li>
      <li>jQuery</li>
      <li>PHP</li>
      <li>Python</li>
    </ul><br>
    <strong>Design</strong>
    <p>I spend a lot of time with working with pixels and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>. Everything I build, I'm always thinking of ways it could be done to be easier to use. I love the work <a href="http://worrydream.com/">Bret Victor</a> does with <a href="http://worrydream.com/#!/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign">interaction design</a>. I go to BarCamp Portland each year and give talks on how to make the world a better place through design. This site is a good example of my web design abilities.</p>
