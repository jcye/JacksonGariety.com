  <h1>Resumé</h1>
  <article>
    <p>Hello, I've been doing design and development for computers for around 4 years.</p>
    <p>You should hire me if you need a front-end developer who demands perfection, interface elegance, and has a unique understanding of human design patterns. Thought it is my specialty, I don't just do front-end, I also write a lot of <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>.</p>
    <strong>This entire website is my resumé</strong>
    <p>Seriously, take a look around. This site is a history of my work experience as well as my life and every notable side project I've done. It showcases my design abilities, my skills with Ruby on Rails and MVC, and my intuition for elegant interface design.</p>
    <strong>2009 - 2012</strong>
    <p>I started doing freelance web design in early 2009. My first clients were local businesses but I slowly grew my abilities and network to pay for better design and development tools.</p>
    <p>Some of my recent client works I regard so highly they're actually featured in the <a href="/#projects">projects</a> section of this site.</p>
    <strong>2012 - Present</strong>
    <p>In 2012 I started working with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/brianjesse">Brian Hendrickson</a> to build a social web platform called HashTraffic which I am currently in the process of developing and selling.</p>
    <p>I also teach a class on app development at Grant High School.</p>
    <strong>Development</strong>
    <p>My favorite framework to use is Ruby on Rails <i>(if you're on this site, you're riding it now!)</i>, but I'm comfortable in a variety of them.</p>
    <ul class="inside">
      <li>HTML/CSS: 100%</li>
      <li>jQuery: 100%</li>
      <li>Non-library JavaScript: 90%</li>
      <li>Ruby on Rails: 85%</li>
      <li>Ruby: 75%</li>
      <li>MySQL: 60%</li>
      <li>Python: 25%</li>
    </ul><br>
    <strong>Design</strong>
    <p>I spend a lot of time with working with pixels and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>. Everything I build, I'm always thinking of ways it could be done to be easier to use. I love the work <a href="http://worrydream.com/">Bret Victor</a> does with <a href="http://worrydream.com/#!/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign">interaction design</a>. I go to BarCamp Portland each year and give talks on how to make the world a better place through design. This site is a good example of my web design aesthetic.</p>
    <strong>Hire me</strong>
